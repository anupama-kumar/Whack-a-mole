THE WHACK A MOLE GAME:

We have 4 ARM-mbeds in total – 1 master node and 3 mole nodes. 

The master node will tell the moles when to pop up (turn on LED), and you have to
whack them (cover their light sensors) as fast as possible. You will be keeping track
of score in total time-to-whack. The game ends after 10 moles are whacked.

Da Rules
1. Game starts only when the player presses a key on the master (connected to
PC for terminal output)
2. Only one mole’s LED should be on at any time
3. Score should be updated continuously
4. The total-time-to-whack is the current score
5. Game ends in 10 rounds (Humans have low battery life)
